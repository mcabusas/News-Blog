China has 704 projects in total. Angola and Ethiopia combined received almost $32 billion of Chinese commitments in the period 2000-2014, almost 10% of the total.\r\nHowever, much of this assistance occurs within an \"informational black hole\" which the study is trying to illuminate.\r\n\r\n\"The Chinese government actually considers the details of its overseas development programs to be a state secret,\" AidData executive director Brad Parks told CNN.\r\n\r\nBeijing\'s secrecy, AidData found, masks a far larger foreign aid footprint than previously estimated.\r\n\r\nAnd while the report finds \"Chinese aid substantially improves economic growth,\" it also deems the majority of current spending less than effective and warns it may undermine efforts to use aid to promote democracy and political reform.\r\n\r\nOver the period 2000-2014, China funded over 4,300 projects in 140 countries to the tune of $354 billion.\r\nTotal US overseas aid during that period was only slightly higher -- $394 billion -- and China actually outspent the US in five of the 15 years studied, according to AidData.\r\n\r\nHowever, Parks said simple dollar totals mask important differences in the nature of the assistance provided.\r\n\r\n\"Chinese government spending nearly rivals US spending during that 15 year period, but the color of the money -- even though they\'re providing roughly comparable amounts -- is very different,\" he said.\r\n\r\nWhile China provides roughly $5 billion a year in official development assistance (ODA), the type of projects most people typically associate with overseas aid, the bulk of its spending is on other official flows (OOF), which do not meet ODA criteria and can include commercial projects.', '2017-10-12', 45, 'uploads/151204121145-zimbabwe-china-handshake-medium-plus-169.jpg', 'Asia'),

It was something that was just intolerable in every way,\" she said. \"And, you know, like so many people who\'ve come forward and spoken out, this was a different side of a person who I and many others had known in the past.\"\r\n\r\nOn her donations, Clinton added that it wasn\'t possible to give the money back but that she would donate it to charity.\r\n\r\n\"What other people are saying, what my former colleagues are saying, is they\'re going to donate it to charity, and of course I will do that,\" she said. \"I give 10% of my income to charity every year, this will be part of that. There\'s no -- there\'s no doubt about it.\"\r\n\r\nClinton said she had no idea that Weinstein acted that way in private, despite some in Hollywood saying that people close to him had known.\r\n\r\n\"I certainly didn\'t, and I don\'t know who did,\" she said. \"But I can only speak for myself, and I think speak for many others who knew him primarily through politics.\"', '2017-10-12', 45, 'uploads/download.jpg', 'America'),

Weinstein was accused of sexual assault in 2015, and Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. were investigated earlier this decade for allegedly misleading real estate buyers.\r\n\r\nance\'s office has faced criticism for accepting a $10,000 donation from David Boies, an attorney for Weinstein, in August 2015, according to campaign financial disclosure forms from the New York State Board of Elections. The donation came just months after Vance\'s office declined to press charges against Weinstein. Stephen Sigmund, a spokesman for Vance, said in a statement that Boies was not Weinstein\'s lawyer in that criminal case.\r\n\r\nAnd a recently published report said a lawyer for the Trump family donated to Vance\'s re-election campaign shortly before his office dropped a fraud investigation.\r\n\r\n\"They had no impact on my thinking,\" Vance said Wednesday at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan.\r\n\r\nA Boies Schiller Flexner spokesman provided a statement to CNN on Wednesday saying that while Boies had represented Weinstein and The Weinstein Company in civil matters, he had never represented them in a criminal matter.\r\n\r\nThe statement said Boies donated to Vance because he believes Vance is a great district attorney.\r\n\r\n\"Neither David, nor anyone in his office, ever spoke to anyone in Mr. Vance\'s office about Harvey Weinstein,\" the statement said.', '2017-10-12', 45, 'uploads/download (3).jpg', 'America'),

But he said the declaration would be suspended, in order to allow for dialogue.\r\n\r\nPuigdemont then led a group of Catalan lawmakers in signing what appeared to be a symbolic declaration of independence. The legal status of the document was unclear.\r\n\r\nRajoy said after a meeting of his cabinet Wednesday that he had formally asked the Catalan government to clarify its actions before deciding how to proceed.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Puigdemont released later, Rajoy said the Catalan leader had until 10 a.m. local time Monday to confirm whether the Catalan parliament had declared independence.\r\n\r\nRajoy warned in the letter that if the answer was yes, and Puigdemont refused to withdraw the declaration by the following Thursday, he could impose direct rule under article 155 of the Spanish constitution.\r\n\r\n\"The council of ministers has agreed to require formally the government of Catalonia to confirm if they have declared the declaration of independence, in spite of the confusion generated by the suspension,\" Rajoy said after the Cabinet meeting.\r\n\r\n\"This requirement -- prior to any measures the government may adopt under article 155 of our constitution -- seeks to offer citizens the clarity and security that such an important issue requires.\"\r\n\r\nHe called on the Catalan authorities to \"return to institutional normality and go back to legality.\" Rajoy has previously refused to hold talks unless Puigdemont drops his independence claim.', '2017-10-12', 45, 'uploads/171010125424-catalonia-police-faceoff-medium-plus-169.jpg', 'Europe'),

Ankara considers Gulen and his followers terrorists, and so has made terror allegations against many of the American detainees.\r\n\r\nUp high on the Turkish government\'s list of grievances is the US\' refusal to extradite Gulen.

He rose knowing that Spain\'s enforcement of the rule of law could -- in the view of many international and also Spanish observers -- be argued to have crossed the line into repression. And, he will have calculated, that a repressed people could, in the eyes of those observers, convince the world that they deserved to go their own way.\r\n\r\nPuigdemont, only two years ago the mayor of the medium-sized Catalan city of Girona, has played his cards cannily. By declaring that Catalans have won the right to independence but that he would first call for some weeks of debate in the regional Parliament, he replaces a disputed vote with a model of democratic process.\r\n\r\nNo one debates the validity of the Catalan Parliament, and the long-missing debate of secession on its merits will occur. Pointedly, the first person to talk after Puigdemont on Tuesday evening was InÃ©s Arrimadas, leader of the anti-secessionist Citizens party in Catalonia.\r\n\r\nBut Puigdemont knows that his side will now have to make its case for independence, rather than just the right to vote. Catalan secessionists have to face the reality that an impressive political and organizational victory won\'t help them with what\'s to come.\r\nClear constitutional problems remain with both the October 1 vote and the anticipated declaration of independence from Spain. \r\n\r\nPuigdemont hasn\'t explained to Catalonia\'s 8.5 million residents the sacrifices that inevitably go with nation building.\r\n', '2017-10-12', 48, 'uploads/171008074950-01-spain-catalonia-independence-1008-medium-plus-169.jpg', 'Europe'),

If Puigdemont was to confirm he did declare independence, he would be given an additional three days to rectify it, until Thursday, Oct. 19 at 0800 GMT. Failing this, Article 155 would be triggered.\r\n\r\nIt is not yet clear if the Catalan government will answer the requirement but it now faces a conundrum, analysts say.\r\n\r\nIf Puigdemont says he did proclaim independence, the central government will step in. If he says he did not declare it, then far-left party CUP would probably withdraw its support for his minority government.\r\n\r\nRajoy has two objectives: if Puigdemont remains ambiguous, the pro-independence movement will get more fragmented; if Puigdemont insists on defending independence then Rajoy will be able to apply Article 155,â€ said Antonio Barroso, deputy director of the London-based research firm Teneo Intelligence.\r\n\r\nâ€œEither way, Rajoyâ€™s aim would be to first restore the rule of law in Catalonia and this could at some point lead to early elections in the region.â€\r\n\r\nThe stakes are high - losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports.', '2017-10-12', 48, 'uploads/download (4).jpg', 'Europe'),

His proposal was not part of the UKâ€™s opening position paper on citizensâ€™ rights, but British negotiators shifted ground in an effort to reach an agreement.\r\n\r\nThe British negotiating team made the offer of a trade-off during the last week of talks at the end of September, after some discussion of the topic in earlier rounds.

Panelâ€ at the Frankfurt Book Fair yesterday (11th October) with members of the trade press, including The Bookseller editor Philip Jones, Reidy said the arguments used by UK publishers to gain exclusive rights to publish in Europe will be redundant after the UK exits the EU. The statement is the clearest indication yet of how territorial rights could come under strain for British publishers in the years ahead, and follows agent Andrew Wylieâ€™s criticism of those publishers attempting to buy global rights, as reported in The Bookseller Daily yesterday.\r\n\r\nâ€œYou asked me about Brexit: I will say, to my mind at least, the argument the British have used to grab Europe as an exclusive market will then be over,â€ said Reidy. â€œThey will try [to make other arguments],â€ she continued. â€œThere are a lot of different issues as to the question of competitiveness in Europe and I donâ€™t think there is necessarily a case to be made. If someone made a case that they could do better if they had it exclusively than if itâ€™s an open market, agents will listen to them. If they canâ€™t make the argument, they wonâ€™t. So, weâ€™ll have our arguments too.â€\r\n\r\nShe added: â€œItâ€™s a principle thing rather than a financial one. I still donâ€™t understand why the British think they have India.â€\r\n\r\nThe Bookseller understands Reidy has privately made the same statements to agents in New York. But the opinion will raise concern among UK publishers, who have long benefited from being able to supply English-language editions of their titles into European markets under exclusive arrangements with agents. The comment has echoes of the so-called turf war arguments of Frankfurt Book Fairs in the mid-Noughties, during which Reidy was a vocal proponent of an open Europe. She was eventually forced to back down because of EU rules that would have meant US editions would have had to be made legally available in the UK in addition to other European territories.\r\n\r\nDuring the panel discussion, Reidy also warned that calls to censor authors that were â€œbubbling up from the publicâ€ were becoming dangerous. Following the social media storm over Simon & Schusterâ€™s since-scrapped publishing deal with controversial right-wing commentator Milo Yiannopoulos, Reidy said there was still a place for â€œbooks that donâ€™t make us so comfortableâ€, arguing that it was â€œessential we defend the right of expression against mob ruleâ€.', '2017-10-12', 48, 'uploads/REIDY 192x181.png', 'Europe'),

But the storm is heading east toward the northwest coast of Spain instead of crossing the Atlantic toward the hurricane-ravaged Caribbean.\r\n\r\nOphelia officially gained hurricane status on Wednesday evening, according to the National Hurricane Center.\r\n\r\nAs of Wednesday evening, Ophelia was moving east at about 3 mph and was expected to gradually turn northeast. Its sustained wind speeds are 75 mph with higher gusts. The storm may still strengthen over the next two days.\r\n\r\nSome of Ophelia\'s rain bands are likely to hit the Azores islands over the weekend.

(105, 'Tokyo, Still top Global Power City.', 'Tokyo remains the top city in Asia for attracting global talent and in third place worldwide, standing a strong chance of overtaking New York soon to clinch the No. 2 spot, according to the latest Global Power City Index ranking released Thursday.\r\n\r\nSTAFF WRITER\r\nOCT 12, 2017\r\nARTICLE HISTORY PRINT SHARE\r\nTokyo remains the top city in Asia for attracting global talent and in third place worldwide, standing a strong chance of overtaking New York soon to clinch the No. 2 spot, according to the latest Global Power City Index ranking released Thursday.\r\n\r\nThe survey, compiled annually by the Mori Memorial Foundationâ€™s Institute for Urban Strategies, assesses the â€œmagnetismâ€ of 44 global cities for attracting creative people and business enterprises and gives scores based on six criteria: economy, environment, livability, research and development, cultural interaction, and accessibility.\r\n\r\nLondon has held the top spot for six straight years, followed by New York, Tokyo, Paris, Singapore, Seoul, Amsterdam, Berlin, Hong Kong and Sydney. Two other Japanese cities, Osaka and Fukuoka, are ranked 26th and 37th respectively.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhile there remains some uncertainty surrounding the U.K.â€™s exit from the EU, Londonâ€™s balanced strengths across several categories mean the city has the potential to turn challenges into opportunities,â€ the report said.\r\n\r\nTokyo this year saw major improvement in its score for cultural interaction. But it slipped into fourth place for the economy criteria, having previously been top in this category throughout the 10 years since the survey started in 2008. Its fall was attributed to a decline in the size of its economy and a reduced rating for its business environment.\r\n\r\nThe report also highlighted weaknesses in Tokyoâ€™s livability (14th) and environment (12th); its livability score was lower than that of Fukuoka, which ranked 13th in the category.\r\n\r\nDespite that, Tokyo still remains strong in the ranking thanks to an improved cultural interaction score, boosted by an increase in the number of foreign visitors to Japan ahead of 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic games, said Hiroo Ichikawa, a professor at Meiji University and an executive director of the Mori Memorial Foundation who helped compile the list.\r\n\r\nThe number of foreign visitors to Japan surpassed 20 million for the first time last year by attracting 24.04 million foreign visitors, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization. The growth trend has continued so far this year, with 18.9 million foreign guests having already visited the country as of August â€” on pace to break last yearâ€™s record.\r\n\r\nWhile Tokyoâ€™s economy rating took a hit, New York was rated highest this year in the category. The vibrant U.S. metropolis was pushed up from its No. 3 spot last year by a strong rating for gross domestic product, but it failed to make significant improvements in overall score.\r\n\r\nAs a result, New York increased its score by just 1.6 points to 1386.3 points, whereas Tokyoâ€™s rating climbed by about 16.2 points from last year to an overall score of 1354.7 points. The gap between the two narrowed to 31.6 points from 46.2 points last year. Londonâ€™s total this year was 1560.1 points.\r\n\r\nThe narrowing gap between overall scores for Tokyo and New York presents an opportunity for Tokyo to surpass New York in the ranking by 2020, Ichikawa said. To raise its score further, the government needs to take further measures to ease regulations and to draw more foreign capital into the country, he said.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe strength of Japan lies in world-class technologies. I believe Japanâ€™s further growth depends on how well it exploits such technologies for urban management,â€ he said.', '2017-10-12', 48, 'uploads/images (1).jpg', 'Asia'),

(107, 'Venezuela Under Dictatorship?', 'Venezuelans go to the polls this Sunday in state elections seen as a test of President NicolÃ¡s Maduroâ€™s willingness to share power. But with polls showing the ruling socialists at risk of landslide losses, the authoritarian government appears to be falling back on a trifecta of tactics. \r\n\r\nManipulation, confusion and fear. \r\n\r\nTwo and half months after the creation of a super congress that gave the government nearly absolute power, Maduro has called the vote for state governors clear evidence that democracy remains alive here. Nevertheless, opposition leaders are decrying a dirty campaign by the Venezuelan government, which President Trump has denounced as a â€œsocialist dictatorship.â€\r\n\r\nState media is airing almost round-the-clock supportive coverage of pro-government candidates, while portraying their challengers as hypocritical and inept. All candidates, meanwhile, are being limited to four minutes of political ads per day on independent networks that now survive by self-censoring.\r\n\r\nAs often happened during the reign of former president Hugo ChÃ¡vez â€” who named Maduro his successor before his death in 2013 â€” food baskets are being doled out to hungry voters at pro-government rallies. In a move seen as purposely misleading, the ballots for Sundayâ€™s election will include a host of candidates who lost in the primaries and are not supposed to be running. This week, the government abruptly announced it would relocate a number of voting centers for â€œsecurity reasons.â€ Opposition leaders said the move involved 205 locations in heavily anti-government districts in 16 states.\r\n\r\nThat, critics say, amounts to manipulation and confusion. \r\n\r\nAnd then thereâ€™s fear.\r\n\r\n[As Maduro takes Venezuela into uncharted waters, the opposition has few options]\r\n\r\nHere in Vargas, a coastal state just north of Caracas, for instance, the brother of opposition candidate Jose Manuel Olivares was detained last week by intelligence police for allegedly stealing a car â€” a charge his family denies. While stumping for votes, the candidate is often shadowed, he said, by state agents. \r\n\r\n\r\nOn a recent afternoon in the narrow streets of a seaside slum, Olivares, an oncologist, was going door-to-door, shaking hands and kissing cheeks. As he walked up to one cement house, a woman watched him nervously from her window before scurrying out of view .\r\n\r\nWhen he knocked, she answered, begging photographers following Olivares to lower their cameras.\r\n\r\nâ€œYou see?â€ he said, wiping sweat off his brow after a short talk with the woman. â€œSheâ€™s scared. They think theyâ€™ll lose whatever the government gives them. Even their jobs, if theyâ€™re public workers.â€ \r\n\r\n[Things are so bad in Venezuela that people are rationing toothpaste]\r\n\r\nWinning candidates from the opposition will likely find their powers restrained. Maduro has said that all governors will come under the authority of the Constituent Assembly, a government-controlled super congress created in a July vote marred by allegations of massive fraud. That body is likely to make life tough for any governor who is not in line with Maduro. \r\n\r\n Yet the vote is still seen as a key test. If turnout is high, polls suggest the opposition could capture governorships in up to 19 of Venezuelaâ€™s 23 states. Analysts are watching to see whether the government faces allegations of vote rigging similar to those that emerged during the July election. Despite the polls, Maduro last weekend said his party is â€œexpecting a historic success.â€\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€œThereâ€™s a chance we might win all of the states, the 23 of them,â€ he said. \r\n\r\nGiven their strategy of subordinating governors to the government-controlled assembly, authorities might risk little by allowing a clean vote â€” while gaining much from the optics. The government may be calculating that such an event could defuse international pressure and appease its domestic opponents. \r\n\r\nâ€œI suspect the government would use a defeat as a kind of victory â€” to try to push back against the evidence that itâ€™s taking total power,â€ said Guillermo Zubillaga, head of a working group on Venezuela at the Americas Society/Council of the Americas, a business and educational group based in New York.\r\n\r\nStill, the election is an important bellwether for the opposition, which has largely failed to sustain the large-scale street protests that rocked the nation earlier this year. The activistsâ€™ concern now is that government tactics â€” and a general sense of helplessness among voters â€” may depress turnout on Sunday.\r\n\r\n\r\nVenezuelaâ€™s government spokesman did not respond to repeated requests for comment. However, in public statements, Venezuelan authorities have denied an uneven playing field, arguing that some measures â€” such as relocating polling stations â€” were taken for legitimate security reasons. Maduro, meanwhile, has blasted the opposition for decrying fraud before the vote has taken place.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe opposition maintains its anti-democratic tactics,â€ he said last weekend on national television.\r\n\r\nMaduro is deeply unpopular, in part due to a severe economic crisis brought on by declining oil prices and what many view as government mismanagement. Recent polls show the president\'s approval rating at 23 percent. But opposition leaders have also lost support due to infighting and alleged disorganization. Some critics have pilloried them for even participating in the state elections, arguing the move is validating the government and playing into Maduroâ€™s hands.\r\n\r\nOpposition leaders respond that by running, they are providing hope to Venezuelans, who are enduring the worldâ€™s highest inflation rate and severe shortages of food and medicine. \r\n\r\nâ€œIf people understand that with these elections they\'re moving one step forward to overthrow Maduro, they\'ll vote,â€ Olivares said.\r\n\r\nVargas state has been a pro-government bastion since Chavezâ€™s rise in 1999. It is home to a massive number of public employees because of its port and airport, as well as once prominent government-owned companies. \r\n\r\nBut most of those state operations are now deeply run down or broke. In addition, there has been a sharp decline in tourists, who once filled local hotels. A large part of the population now struggles to survive off government benefits. \r\n\r\nOlivares sees a possible window here. Five years ago, when he ran unsuccessfully for governor, he wasnâ€™t even able to enter the slums.\r\n\r\nâ€œPeople would chase us out with rocks and insults,â€ Olivares said. â€œWhat youâ€™re seeing today was unthinkable back then.â€\r\n\r\nHe has built support in part by taking a page from the governmentâ€™s playbook â€” establishing eight public kitchens funded by private donations that serve daily lunches to 150 children. \r\n\r\nAs he campaigned in the streets recently, desperation was evident. People dragged Olivares to ill family members and handed him unfilled prescriptions. At one point during his visit to a slum here, residents brought him to the home of an elderly woman whose foot was covered by a dark bruises.\r\n\r\nâ€œI have a venous ulcer and I canâ€™t treat it, doctor,â€ she said, adding her medicine was unavailable.

(111, 'Europe: In Love with Australia\'s Immigration Policy', 'In October 2015, six weeks after Tony Abbott was deposed as Australiaâ€™s prime minister in a fit of intraparty backstabbing, he arrived in London to give the Margaret Thatcher memorial lecture at Guildhall. Standing before an audience of Conservative party luminaries, he praised the Iron Lady before launching into a spirited defence of Australiaâ€™s controversial immigration policy. According to Abbott, his governmentâ€™s harsh measures â€“ forcibly turning around refugee boats to prevent them landing, and sending asylum seekers to detention camps on remote Pacific islands â€“ had ended the arrival of unwanted migrants in Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stories you need to read, in one handy email\r\n Read more\r\nAfter a summer when more than a million asylum seekers had streamed into Europe, Abbott lectured the assembled Tories about the perils of loving oneâ€™s neighbour as oneself, calling it a â€œwholesome instinct [that is] leading much of Europe into catastrophic errorâ€. Due to â€œmisguided altruismâ€, Europe was weakening itself, argued Abbott, and the only way to reverse the tide, he insisted, was emulating Australiaâ€™s policy.\r\n\r\nWhether those turned away died in another countryâ€™s waters or back in the countries they initially fled did not figure in his equation. By removing images of boats capsizing off Australiaâ€™s shores from local television and ensuring that more migrants seeking asylum did not arrive in the country, his work was done. Nor was he bothered by the fact that the offshore camps in Nauru and Papua New Guinea were still operating, at a cost of billions of dollars.\r\n\r\nThe core of Abbottâ€™s argument was that refugees seeking asylum were simply trying to cheat the system by travelling to wealthier western countries. â€œIn Europe, as with Australia,â€ he said, â€œpeople claiming asylum â€“ invariably â€“ have crossed not one border but many; and are no longer fleeing in fear but are contracting in hope with people smugglers. However desperate, almost by definition, they are economic migrants,â€ â€“ even though many asylum seekers arriving in Europe and Australia have passed through countries that are unsafe or do not offer asylum because they are not party to the UN refugee convention.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\nâ€œOur moral obligation is to receive people fleeing for their lives. Itâ€™s not to provide permanent residency to anyone and everyone who would rather live in a prosperous western country,â€ said Abbott. He denounced the EU and Nato rescue missions in the Mediterranean as too kind. For Abbott, rescuing migrants on capsizing boats was â€œa facilitator [for migration] rather than a deterrentâ€.\r\n\r\nBut as the rest of his speech made plain, the real allure of Australiaâ€™s offshoring policy was ideological, not simply logistical. For Abbott, the seas surrounding Australia and Europe were fronts in a new battle, in which desperate asylum seekers appeared as an invading horde threatening western civilisation itself: â€œIt will gnaw at our consciences â€“ yet it is the only way to prevent a tide of humanity surging through Europe and quite possibly changing it for ever.â€ An anonymous Tory minister labelled the speech â€œfascisticâ€. Nigel Farage called Abbott â€œheroicâ€.\r\n\r\nAlthough it rarely makes the news, Australiaâ€™s immigration policy has become a beacon for Europeâ€™s far right. From France to Holland and Denmark, politicians point to the Australian model as the solution for Europeâ€™s refugee crisis, and they are not talking about the points system that Australia uses to determine the educational and skill levels of potential immigrants. The real attraction, especially since the massive refugee influx of 2015, is offshoring.\r\n\r\nThe Nauru files: the lives of asylum seekers in detention detailed in a unique database â€“ interactive\r\nRead incident reports written by staff in Australiaâ€™s immigration detention centre on Nauru\r\n Read more\r\nRather than assess the asylum claims of people arriving by boat or rescuing them at sea, the Australian navy intercepts asylum seekers, towing them back or putting them into small sealed pods and sending them off in the direction of Indonesia. Those who reach Australian territory are sent to detention camps on Nauru or Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. Both camps are paid for by the Australian government and run by private contractors. The inmates can claim asylum there â€“ but not in Australia â€“ while they remain in miserable conditions of confinement designed to deter others from attempting the same journey. If people seeking asylum are never allowed to reach Australian shores, so the logic goes, they will never have a legitimate claim to refugee status in the country or access to its legal protections and welfare benefits.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\nFor far-right leaders promising to stop the hordes from storming Europe, the model has undeniable appeal. A month before Abbottâ€™s speech, just after the corpse of three-year-old Syrian refugee Alan Kurdi washed up on a Turkish beach, Nigel Farage, then leader of the UK Independence party (Ukip), announced that â€œif the European Union had the right policy, people would know they would not be accepted by coming across the water, just as the Australians dealt with this problem, and that would stop the drownings from happeningâ€.\r\n\r\nDouglas Carswell, Ukipâ€™s only member of parliament at the time, argued: â€œThere are lessons to learn from Australia. Itâ€™s come up with something that works.â€\r\n\r\nUkip is not the only party on the European right looking to Australia for inspiration. In France, Yohann Faviere, one of the Front Nationalâ€™s local leaders, thinks it is the only viable model. â€œWhen they find a boat in the sea, they send the migrants back,â€ he says admiringly of the Australians. He is bothered by the drownings, but adamant that Europe should not be in the business of rescuing refugees. â€œThe boats found in the Med need to be sent back to where they came from.â€\r\n\r\nFrits Bolkestein, the former leader of Hollandâ€™s centre-right VVD party, who gave Geert Wilders his first political job, agrees that Australia has the answer to Europeâ€™s current problems. â€œThe better we treat them, the more they come,â€ he says. â€œIf you donâ€™t want them to come, you should not treat them all that well, which is what the Australians do.â€ Bolkestein insists that Australian-style controls are the only solution as more and more of the worldâ€™s poor, whether they are refugees or not, seek to move to Europe. â€œLook at the United Nationsâ€™ statistics about African natality,â€ he says. â€œItâ€™s most disturbing. Countries like Central African Republic, itâ€™s a failed state, and they go on producing children. Do we want them to come here? No, we donâ€™t, so what do we do? Australian solution.â€\r\n\r\nWhen pressed on whether this would actually solve the problem of asylum seekers coming to Europe, he concedes that it wouldnâ€™t. â€œWe are trained in the west to think that every problem has a solution,â€ he says. â€œThereâ€™s no solution to this, unless we adopt very nasty measures.â€ And nasty measures have become an Australian specialty.\r\n\r\nFor European culture warriors, Australiaâ€™s appeal is that it is an advanced western democracy that has managed to morally and legally outsource the processing and resettlement of refugees to poor island nations in the Pacific, where they are warehoused far from the prying eyes of the media and a population that might show them sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe politicians who demand what Bolkestein calls â€œnasty measuresâ€ invariably justify them by invoking the spectre of an imminent civilisational threat. What is actually a legal and logistical problem has been transformed into a kulturkampf by politicians who know that fomenting fear wins votes. After all, the refugee issue would not resonate so powerfully without the manufactured alarm that European civilisation itself might be destroyed by Muslim usurpers.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\nMany of those promoting the idea that the arrival of refugees from the Middle East and Africa presages the â€œsuicide of Europeâ€ have been inspired by the apocalyptic vision of a 1973 novel, The Camp of the Saints, which depicts the shores of France being overrun by boats full of â€œscraggy branches, brown and blackâ€ and â€œfleshless Gandhi-armsâ€. (â€œThe Third World had started to overflow its banks â€¦ and the west was its sewer.â€) The new rightâ€™s leading lights, from Marine Le Pen to Steve Bannon, hail the bookâ€™s author, Jean Raspail, as a prophet. At the peak of the refugee crisis in September 2015, Le Pen warned of the â€œhundreds of thousands of migrants who will come tomorrowâ€ and urged the French to read Raspailâ€™s work.\r\n\r\nIn the novel, the arrival by sea of 800,000 people causes a clash between the self-appointed defenders of French civilisation and the radicals, intellectuals and hippies who welcome the newcomers. Although Raspailâ€™s imagined invaders were Hindus fleeing India, the image of the brown masses descending upon the west has been conveniently taken up by the anti-Muslim right to satisfy current political tastes. When the boats finally reach France, Raspail describes the landing as a â€œpeaceful assault on the western worldâ€. One of the bookâ€™s heroes is the captain of a Greek ship who rams flailing refugees in the water. A naval captain advises the French president: â€œWe have to make a choice. Either we open our doors to these people and take them in. Or we torpedo every one of their boats, at night, when itâ€™s too dark to see their faces as we kill them.â€\r\n\r\nApart from the former leader of Germanyâ€™s anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party, Frauke Petry, who has openly called for German police to shoot asylum seekers illegally crossing the border, few western politicians have advocated violence to force migrants away. But the appeal of the Australian model for the European far right is the absolute commitment to keeping refugees out at all costs â€“ it is not about â€œmanagingâ€ migrants, but defending the nation from them. The policy prescription that Abbott brought to London was a simple one: turn boats back, deny entry at borders and build camps abroad. Some force would be necessary, he admitted â€“ and a lot of money.\r\n\r\nBetween 2013 and 2016, the government spent around A$9.6bn (Â£5.6bn) on intercepting migrant boats, transporting asylum seekers, and paying foreign governments to detain them overseas, thus absolving Australia of legal responsibility for their living conditions and of any obligation to grant them refugee status in Australia if their asylum claim is found to be genuine. The total cost is approximately A$400,000 (Â£236,000) per detained asylum seeker per year. The public has generally gone along with it, as have both political parties, preferring to spend those exorbitant sums to keep the problem out of sight and out of mind, rather than allow refugees a chance to start over in Australia and share the fruits of its generous welfare state â€“ which welcomes close to 200,000 immigrants with visas each year.', '2017-10-12', 48, 'uploads/2048.jpg', 'Australia'),

Itâ€™s hard to tell.\r\nABC election analyst Antony Green told news.com.au that turnout for the Brexit vote in the UK was 72.2 per cent and just 51.9 per cent voted to leave.\r\nâ€œNo one has questioned that result even though it was relatively close,â€ Mr Green said.\r\nHe said the Brexit vote was a good comparison because it was a yes/no vote and people were also voting for a principle, not a piece of legislation.\r\nâ€œNo one knew what Brexit actually meant and they still donâ€™t,â€ he said.\r\nIn comparison the Irish referendum to approve same-sex marriage was also carried with 60.52 per cent turnout and 62.07 of the vote.\r\n\r\nMr Green said he expected the turnout for Australiaâ€™s postal survey to be similar to the Brexit vote, judging from the numbers that had already returned their surveys.\r\n\r\nHe said how much of a turnout was required to make the vote â€œlegitimateâ€ depended on how people measured these things.\r\nHowever, he was confident Yes was likely to win.\r\n\r\nâ€œYes is still 20 per cent ahead (according to recent polls), no turnout (figure) is going to turn that into a No vote,â€ he said.\r\nWhile polls ahead of Brexit were wrong, Mr Green said they were only off by about 2 to 3 per cent â€” although in that case it was enough to turn the result.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey werenâ€™t wrong by 15 per cent,â€ he said.\r\nBut one expert is unsure that achieving a good turnout and a â€œsimple majorityâ€ will be enough to silence critics in Australia.\r\n\r\nIt is not compulsory to vote in the postal survey which means people not happy with the result could still argue it doesnâ€™t represent all of Australiaâ€™s views.\r\n\r\nPolitical scientist Sarah Maddison of the University of Melbourne said it would require leadership from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to legitimise the vote.\r\n\r\nâ€œI think there is very little question the Yes vote will be in the majority but the size of the majority is going to count in terms of the silencing the conservatives,â€ she said.\r\n\r\nâ€œI think this has been one of the problems with the survey from the outset: there has been no clear guidance from the government about what could constitute a legitimate response.â€\r\nEven if the turnout reached 70 per cent as Mr Green predicts, Prof Maddison was sceptical a simple 51 per cent majority would decide the issue.\r\n\r\nâ€œIt is very hard to imagine (prominent No voter) Lyle Shelton accepting graciously that he and his colleagues in the No camp are in the minority,â€ she said.\r\n\r\nâ€œNo campaigners and radical conservatives will keep pushing to have their reactionary position maintained in policy decisions.â€\r\nProf Maddison wasnâ€™t sure what percentage the Yes vote would have to reach in order to silence critics, and said she would be â€œpicking a number out of the airâ€.\r\n\r\nâ€œCertainly 51 per cent wonâ€™t do it. I donâ€™t think anyone involved in the campaign for marriage equality thinks that a simple majority will end the matter.\r\n\r\nâ€œMaybe itâ€™s 60 per cent, maybe itâ€™s 70 per cent, I donâ€™t know. Weâ€™ve lacked clear leadership from the Prime Minister on that question,â€ she said.\r\n\r\nIn past statements, Mr Turnbull has said he believes the result would be respected in parliament.\r\nâ€œIf the postal vote is carried, the legalisation of same-sex marriage will sail through the Parliament, believe me,â€ he told 2DayFM.\r\nBut Prof Maddison said it would still require leadership.\r\n\r\nâ€œThis has to be the end of the matter but this has to come from our political leaders,â€ she said.\r\n\r\nShe urged people who had not yet voted not to be complacent.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe need as many Australians as possible (to vote) to have as much validity as possible to make sure this question is answered once and for all.â€', '2017-10-12', 48, 'uploads/b81f068508d36bfcf52867a34e9efad3.jpg', 'Australia'),
(116, 'How Putin came to Rule the Middle Eastern', 'When Russia entered the Syrian civil war in September 2015 the then US secretary of defense, Ash Carter, predicted catastrophe for the Kremlin. Vladimir Putin was â€˜pouring gasoline on the fireâ€™ of the conflict, he said, and his strategy of fighting Isis while backing the Assad regime was â€˜doomed to failureâ€™. Two years on, Putin has emerged triumphant and Bashar al-Assadâ€™s future is secure. They will soon declare victory over Isis inside the country.\r\n\r\nThe dismal failure turned out to be our cynical effort to install a Sunni regime in Damascus by adopting the Afghanistan playbook from the 1980s. We would train, fund and arm jihadis, foreign and domestic, in partnership with the Gulf Arab despots. This way we would rob Russia of its only warm-water naval base, Tartus, on Syriaâ€™s Mediterranean coast. In the process we would create a buffer between Iran and its Lebanon-based proxy, Hezbollah, to divide the anti-Israel Shia axis. And we would further marginalise Iran by extending the influence of our Sunni Gulf allies from Lebanon deeper into the Levant. Half a million Syrians were slaughtered as a consequence of this hare-brained scheme, which geo-politically has resulted in the exact opposite of the intended outcome.\r\n\r\nPutin, though, had grasped the reality at the outset. Unlike Afghans, ordinary Syrians were used to living in a liberal, diverse culture that, while politically repressive, championed peaceful religious co-existence. Most of them were nervous about seeing their country transformed into a Wahhabi theocracy. Assad, for all his faults, was the buffer between them and internecine carnage. They stuck with the devil they knew, and there was no popular revolution against Assad â€” nothing compared to the Tahrir uprising that ousted the hated Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak. The millions-strong demonstrations in Damascus were pro-regime. Among the two-thirds of the Syrian population now living in governmentâ€“controlled parts of the country, Assad is more popular than ever, and Putin is a hero.\r\n\r\nSmall wonder Putin recently mocked Washington for â€˜not knowing the difference between Austria and Australiaâ€™. The same charge could, alas, be levelled at Nato leaders generally. At a UN meeting last month, the Orwellian-named Friends of Syria group â€” the western and Gulf Arab alliance that unleashed jihad â€” stated they would not engage in reconstruction efforts until (in Boris Johnsonâ€™s words) there was a political â€˜move away fromâ€™ Assad. But weeks earlier, a massive international conference on reconstruction had taken place in Damascus. During it, Assad had ruled out awarding the multi-billion-dollar contracts up for grabs to hostile western and Arab countries on the grounds that they had destroyed his country.\r\n\r\nInstead, Syria would look east, and especially to Russia, Iran and China. Already Moscow is busy shipping thousands of tons of materials and more than 40 pieces of construction equipment â€” including bulldozers and cranes â€” to Syria, which does not want or need our assistance.\r\n\r\nAn inability to acknowledge, still less confront, Russiaâ€™s expanding regional role on the back of Syria was similarly highlighted during a whirlwind trip Johnson made to Libya in August. There, he had a brief meeting with secular strongman Khalifa Haftar, a former general in Gaddafiâ€™s army whose forces now dominate eastern Libya â€” including Benghazi and most of the countryâ€™s major oil fields. He is determined to overrun Tripoli, and probably will. Haftar has ties with Moscow going back to the early 1970s and has been in Putinâ€™s pocket for at least two years, repeatedly meeting with Russian officials on an aircraft-carrier off the Mediterranean coast. A week before shaking hands with Johnson, Haftar had visited Moscow to hold extensive discussions with top officials from the defence and foreign ministries. They cemented plans to move fragmented Libya towards statehood under Haftar as an all-powerful defence minister, with direct Russian military aid. The Kremlin has already deployed troops and fighter jets to western Egypt to join that country and the UAE, which is also backing Haftar in his unifying fight against the Islamists. As with Syria, for decades before the fall of Gaddafi, Russia was Libyaâ€™s biggest arms supplier and closest international ally, and Moscow has long been eyeing a naval base on the Libyan coastline to complement its (now much beefed-up) base in Tartus. Given all this, as Johnson suggested that Haftar may have a â€˜role to playâ€™ in any future political reconciliation, while insisting that he abide by an internationally brokered ceasefire, the latter must have found it hard to contain his laughter.\r\n\r\nSyria and Libya, though, are just two examples of how Russia is running rings around the West in its determination to achieve superpower status in the Middle East. Putin has just inked a deal with Turkey â€” which has Natoâ€™s second-largest standing army â€” to sell the latter its most advanced S-400 air defence system. (The S-400 has already been deployed across Syria, while Iran has been given the less advanced but still formidable S-300.) Shortly after Russia entered the Syrian war, Turkey had shot down one of its planes. It was a deliberate attempt to provoke a wider war by President Recep Erdogan, who was furious that Putin was, by way of a relentless bombing campaign, putting an end to his support for Isis foot soldiers inside Syria and his purchasing of oil from the caliphate. (Nato had ignored all this duplicity in the hope that Isis would weaken Assad.) It is testament to Putinâ€™s extraordinary diplomatic skills that Russia and Turkey are these days singing each otherâ€™s praises as never before. And under Russian auspices, Turkey is working with Iran and Iraq to contain the fallout from the Kurdish referendum on independence.', '2017-10-12', 45, 'uploads/Putin-cover.jpg', 'Middle Eastern'),
(117, 'The Iraqi Kurdish Referendum: How It Affects Middle East Geopolitics', 'The Kurdish people are an ethnic group of approximately 25 to 35 million people quartered in the region comprising South Eastern Turkey, Northern Syria and Iraq, and the North West part of Iran. A very small sliver of Armenia also has their presence. They have been in the news from time to time, especially because of the internal conflict that the Turkish segment was part of, for separation from Turkey, more prominently since the end of the Ottoman Empire. The Iraqi segment has suffered at the hands of Saddam Hussein and long fought the Iraqi Army.\r\n\r\nToday, the deep international interest in the Kurdish people arises from the 25 September 2017 referendum initiated under the Iraqi Kurd leader Massud Barzani to decide through a vote the freedom of the Iraqi segment. This interest is generated for quite a few reasons beyond just the recent referendum.\r\n\r\nFirst, the Kurds of the entire region are one of the largest ethnic segments without a nation and their aspiration for the creation of a greater Kurdish state (call it Kurdistan) creates geopolitical problems across a swathe of sensitive territories in the Middle East.\r\n\r\nSecond, with the ongoing Syrian civil war, the dynamics of influence and control is changing rapidly and no one wants a change in the power balance. Creation of even a single independent Kurdish enclave in one state may have a cascading effect among the Kurdish people in the other states.\r\n\r\nThird, each of the four main nations, which have a Kurdish minority, do not wish to see any redrawing of boundaries because that has its own unpredictability of the manner in which geopolitics play out.\r\n\r\nFourth, a trigger of any of the segments seeking breakaway will be considered by the international community as one more contributory factor towards the turbulence and instability in an already highly turmoil ridden region, the effects of which are having impact much further away from the boundaries of the region itself. The creation of a diversion can actually give a reprieve to the Islamic State (IS), which is on its last legs after defeats at Mosul and lately at Hawija, which lies in the Kurdish territory.\r\n\r\nAlthough the current international interest is thrown up by the decision of the Iraqi Kurdish segment to conduct a referendum for independence which isnâ€™t the first time that the Kurdish Iraqi segment is at conflict with the government of Iraq. After years of battling the Iraq government a settlement was reached in 1970 for limited autonomy. It was never implemented leading to a second civil war, which continued into the 1980s even as the Iran-Iraq war raged from 1981 onwards.\r\n\r\nIn 1988, the Iraq government allegedly used chemical weapons to cause large-scale casualties against the Iraqi Kurds. The situation somewhat improved after the defeat of Saddam Husseinâ€™s forces in Gulf War I, and the declaration of a no-fly zone in northern Iraq. The Kurds rose again, almost in sync, with the Iraqi Shias in the South and the Kurdish resistance army known as the Peshmerga succeeded in pushing the Iraqi forces out of the Erbil region thus leading to de facto autonomy but not independence. The bone of contention for the Iraq government was always the oil rich Kirkuk area which was largely inhabited by Kurds. Saddam Hussein had initiated the \'Arabisation\' of this area through displacement and resettlement, an issue now causing problems in that region of Iraq.\r\n\r\nSo, why are the Kurds suddenly taking to this brazen expression of independence; what has triggered it? Firstly, the actions of the Iraqi Kurds are not in isolation or without consultation with the pan-Kurd movement. The Turkish separatist group PKK in South Eastern Turkey is sensing a weakening of Turkey with Recep Tayyip Erdoganâ€™s steps, which are taking Turkey away from Europe and have created sufficient cleavage with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The Iraqi Kurds have played a major role in the defeat of the IS through the Peshmergaâ€™s role in the north. They also sense that post the final defeat of IS and the end of Syrian civil war, there could be a demand to redraw maps.\r\n\r\nThe Referendum of 25 September 2017, which was in favour independence, was also driven by a sense of frustration with the government of Iraq which under the Shia dispensation has not been the fairest of governments. The Kurdish segment of Iraq has witnessed an economic boom after the 2003 fall of Saddam Hussein but now that is flattening. In addition, the positive role of the Peshmerga against IS has given the Kurds a perception that they deserve independence just for this.\r\n\r\nFrance is playing a pro-active role in preventing a crisis being precipitated just when the IS looks to be disappearing from Iraq. With Iraqâ€™s Prime Minister Haider Al Abadi visiting Paris, Franceâ€™s President Emmanuel Macron is leading the efforts to ensure that dialogue between the Kurds and Iraqi Arabs begins at the earliest. This dialogue is being looked at as the instrument for unity, integrity and sovereignty of Iraq, while recognising Kurdish rights. Will the Iraqi Kurdish segment be willing to give up their demands in a situation in which they perceive they can maximise what they wish to achieve,will be the question?\r\n\r\nThe role of Iran will be crucial. The leadership of Iran and Turkey has just met to ensure that there is no trigger for Kurdish nationalism beyond what has already happened in Iraq. However, given the fires of nationalism and the desire to prevent more armed conflict in a fatigued region, Iraq may well be forced to grant much more autonomy to Iraqi Kurds with little federal control. However, the initial responses of the Iraqi government have been completely knee-jerk in nature; preventing the banks in Iraqi Kurdish territory from conducting foreign currency exchange and stoppage of direct foreign travel to the northern region.\r\n\r\nIsrael is accused of provoking and sponsoring the rise in separatist trends as it wishes to see the hold of Iran and Syria balanced out by a Greater Kurdistan, particularly in the Levant region. However, this has been denied by Israel.\r\n\r\nSince the attention is now focused on the potential future dispensation and management of Middle East affairs in the presumed post-IS era, the Kurdish issue comes as another unpredictable factor. The US is unlikely to support the independence of the breakaway Kurdish regions although it had supported the Peshmergaâ€™s fight against Saddam Hussain.\r\n\r\nWith ethnic and nationalist trends coming back to the fore, akin to the heady days in the aftermath of the Cold War in 1989, and new separatist tendencies in Catalonia and some other regions, the Kurdish issue is likely to remain a major pinprick in the Middle East in the times to come.', '2017-10-12', 45, 'uploads/Referendum Turkey.jpg', 'Middle Eastern'),
(118, 'Support for Saudi Arabia\'s war in Yemen targeted by bill in US Congress', 'Pulling support for Saudi Arabiaâ€™s war in Yemen is not enough: the United States must go further and probe whether its decades-old ties with Riyadh have helped it â€“ or simply sucked Washington into divisive, bungled Middle Eastern quagmires, US Congressman Ro Khanna told Middle East Eye.\r\n\r\nKhanna, a Democrat representative for Californiaâ€™s Silicon Valley area, urged the House to vote this week on his bill to stop helping the Saudi-led coalition with military targeting and the mid-air refuelling of warplanes in Yemen.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe average person in my district, or Ohio or Pennsylvania, does not want us risking American troops or spending American tax dollars on fighting the Houthis in Yemen, and they certainly donâ€™t want us complicit in human rights violations,â€ Khanna told MEE on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nKhannaâ€™s bill says Congress was never asked if the US should effectively join Riyadhâ€™s assault on the Iran-backed Houthi rebels of northern Yemen, and demands that it exit the war within 30 days of an affirmative vote.\r\n\r\nThe billâ€™s opponents say it does not meet the criteria needed for a fast-tracked House vote, which could otherwise occur this week. Previous congressional efforts to halt US arms supplies to the Saudi-led coalition came close, but did not pass.\r\n\r\nCongress granted the White House broad war-making powers after the 9/11 attacks, but that did not authorise helping Saudi fight the Houthis, said Khanna. The war may well assist the real US enemy there â€“ al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\r\n\r\nProgressives and right-wing constitutionalists view open-ended Middle Eastern conflicts as liabilities and are increasingly challenging a foreign policy establishment of hawks, neo-conservatives and liberal interventionists, said Khanna 40, a former law scholar.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere is a re-orientation in our relationship with Saudi Arabia, a recognition we should not be aiding their regime and its human rights violations or supporting the export of extremist ideology,â€ Khanna told MEE.\r\n\r\nThe Saudi-led coalitionâ€™s war in Yemen has proven increasingly controversial in the US and Britain â€“ two Western countries that supply Riyadh with the weapons, intelligence and other support in its two-and-a-half-year-old conflict.\r\n\r\nFighting has claimed 10,000 lives in a nation of 28 million people, where a quarter of the population is starving, the United Nations says. At least 2,135 people, most of them children, have died in a virulent cholera outbreak these past six months\r\n\r\nUN figures released this month said the alliance had caused death and injury to 683 children in 2016, including in attacks on schools and hospitals â€“ earning the coalition a spot on a global blacklist of childrenâ€™s rights violators.\r\n\r\nFormer US President Barack Obama originally approved support for Saudi, the United Arab Emirates and other US allies in a move that was widely viewed as a concession to Riyadh over Washingtonâ€™s 2015 nuclear deal with its regional foe, Iran.\r\n\r\nCurrently, aerial refuelling provided by American aircraft enables bombing runs by Saudi and UAE warplanes, while the US government provides the coalition with intelligence and fresh supplies of weapons.\r\n\r\nThe conflict pits President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi\'s Saudi-backed government, which controls south and eastern Yemen, against the Houthis and other rebel groups in a shaky alliance with forces loyal to ousted President Ali Abdullah Saleh.\r\n\r\nAccording to Amnesty International and other rights watchdogs, coalition jets have destroyed hospitals, schools and, last October, killed 140 civilians in a mistaken strike on a funeral in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe USA and other states that supply arms for use by the Saudi Arabia-led coalition in Yemen must stop doing so and the UN Security Council should impose an arms embargo to bring an end to such horrific abuses,â€ said Sherine Tadros, head of the UN office for Amnesty International in New York.\r\n\r\nSaudi officials say they work to minimise civilian casualties and have accused the Houthis of using human shields.

At the top of his agenda will be reining in Iran, a close Russian ally seen as a deadly foe by most Gulf Arab states.\r\n\r\nUntil very recently, Washington stood alone as the go-to destination for such leaders. Right now, American power in the region is perceptibly in retreat -- testimony to the success of Russiaâ€™s military intervention in Syria, which shored up President Bashar al-Assad after years of U.S. insistence that he must go.\r\n\r\nâ€œIt changed the reality, the balance of power on the ground,â€ said Dennis Ross, who was Americaâ€™s chief Mideast peace negotiator and advised several presidents from George H.
